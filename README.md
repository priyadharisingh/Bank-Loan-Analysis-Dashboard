# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Dashboard
The dashboard provides an idea about the key metrics in the loan report of the bank.

# Background:
The bank sanction thousands of loan in a day, to keep a track of all of these in the form of dataset is not visually appealing and consumes a lot of time of the day. Creating a dashboard that keeps the track of all the information makes the job easier. It also gives clear idea about the loan sanctioned, interest expected on the loan, funded amount and dti.
Relevant measures could be taken to reduce bad loans, track funding, and complete the monthly loan target.

# Assumptions:
•	The data does not contain manually created bias.
•	Live updates depend on syncing frequency (daily/hourly).

# Dashboard design:

1.	Loan Overview:
This kpi provides a detailed idea about the total loan application, total amount funded, total amount received, average interest rate, average DTI. Just by viewing these metrics the stakeholders can get a bigger picture amount the loan. 

2.	Area wise distribution:
The map shows the state where people take most amount of loan. Most amount of loans are taken by people in NV. We can also have an idea about the purpose for which people are taking the loan by filtering it with purpose slicer.

# Analysis:
1.	13.8% of the loans sanctioned are bad loans. The good loans account to 86.18% of the total amount funded. By receiving interest on good loans the bank is able to make the original principle amount. However, measures need to be taken if they want to keep operating and make profits in long run.
2.	Loans taken for small business accounts to 25.62% of total bank loan. The bank needs to ensure proper checking before sanctioning these loans. Additionally, loans taken for the purpose of renewable energy, moving, house, education, and other accounts to another more than 15% of the total bad loans each taken individually.
3.	The most important reason why people take loans is for debt consolidation, the period of such loan is 10+ years and since they account to approximately 15% of bad loan, there is a greater need to bring regulatory measure to keep a check on these loans.
# Conclusion:
The dashboard is of provides real time access to stakeholders about the operations of the bank. This dashboard can help reduce the bad loans sanctioned by the bank and help make informed decisions.
